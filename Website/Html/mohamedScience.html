            <b> To understand the concept of computer science</b>, we have to know the                   
            basic definition of computers.                       
        
            <b> A computer</b> is an electronic, digital device that are cable of execute a lot                    
            of arithmetic or logical operations:                
            computers will get that operations done by a set of instructions (a program).                  
                
             Therefore, Computer science is the study of computations of data and                     
            storing it into useful information to be easily used later.              

                Besides that, Algorithms and data structures are mainly considered central                        
            to the computer science field.so it’s essentially problem-solving.                   
             
             But there is a massive mix-up and misunderstanding of computer science,                  
            that it’s focuses at the hardware of a computer, that’s not accurate:                   
            the main focus is on the theory of computation, computer scientists design                   
            algorithms, study the performance of computer hardware and software.                   
             
             Still, hardware and software are interconnected, without software,                   
            the hardware of a computer would have no function.                     
            However, without the creation of hardware to perform tasks                  
            directed by software via the central processing unit, software would be useless.

         until his death 11 years later in 1635.</p>

           <p><b>An English banker, Charles Babbage knows as "the father of computers"</b> who was interested in math at early age, teaching himself algebra.<br> 
            he started the design of <b>the first automatic mechanical calculator</b>, his Difference Engine. <br>
            <b>in 1822</b>, which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine.

        The analytical engine combined concepts from his work and other scientists to create it, 
        it was destructed with some features similar to the properties modern computer have nowadays, 
        these properties include features such as an internal "scratch memory" equivalent to RAM, 
        multiple forms of output including a bell, a graph-plotter, and simple printer, and a programmable input-output "hard"
         memory of punch cards which it could modify as well as read. The key advancement which Babbage's devices possessed beyond
          those created before his was that each component of the device was independent of the rest of the machine, much like the components of a 
          modern electronic computer. This was a fundamental shift in thought; previous computational devices served only a single purpose, but had 
          to be at best disassembled and reconfigured to solve a new problem. Babbage's devices could be reprogramed to solve new problems by the entry of new data,
         and act upon previous calculations within the same series of instructions

           Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G,

             and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason. 
             The engine was never completed so her program was never tested.

            During Alan Turing’s life, he made many significant breakthroughs in the realm of computer science.<br>
             One of the largest breakthroughs he made was the Turing Test in 1950. The Turing Test is to see if machines can “think”
              (Turing Computing Machinery), and the Turing Test was also used to see how humanlike a machine was. In the Turing Test,
               Alan Turing says that there are many different things a machine has to be asked in order to pass the test, and to see if the machine or
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) can “think” like a human.<b>here is a simple video to help you get a better understanding</b> <br> <br> This test is now used to help test AI, and to see how programmers, and other large development 
                teams can create a humanlike AI. Many computer science classes teach the basic concepts of the Turing Test. The class is usually a
                 “Theory of Computation” class (Kelkar). Understanding Alan Turing’s theories has been very beneficial in the development of AI and th
                 e improvement of computer science.
