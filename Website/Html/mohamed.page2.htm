    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.a55c9613d5bf4820f0eaac1a3cfa8235?rik=opgSIJFJ7kzSQw&riu=http%3a%2f%2fnicee.cc%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f05%2f1883-3.jpg&ehk=edDJmVbbk5daXuHycrKyRp3WCkWISq3O7NTMt2OC0fo%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0"id="paral2">
<p id="paral3">Hossam Mohamed El Sayed Metwalli Abdel Sattar Ghaly (Arabic: حسام محمد السيد متولي عبد الستار غالي; born 15 December 1981) is a retired Egyptian footballer who played as a central midfielder.

<h2>Tottenham Hotspur</h2>
<p id="paral4">After three troublesome seasons in the Netherlands, Ghaly joined Tottenham Hotspur of the Premier League in January 2006. Their rivals Arsenal had been interested before he signed a four-and-a-half-year contract at Tottenham.<br>Ghaly was given the number 14 jersey and made his debut against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 9 September 2006.He scored his first goal for Spurs in the UEFA Cup against Beşiktaş on 19 October 2006. During a game against rivals Chelsea on 11 March 2007, he gave Spurs a temporary 3–1 lead in the FA Cup.A week later Ghaly scored his only Premier League goal, in a 3–1 win over Watford. A foul on Ghaly in the middle of the penalty box against Blackburn Rovers saw Jermain Defoe score a penalty kick which resulted in the game ending in 1–1 draw. Ghaly's second encounter with Blackburn however is remembered merely due to its affiliation with infamy.<br>His future at Tottenham was left in doubt after he pulled off his shirt and threw it to the ground after being substituted during a Premier League match against Blackburn on 10 May 2007. Ghaly had been brought on in the first half after an injury to Steed Malbranque, and rebelled when brought off. The Tottenham fans were left angry at Ghaly's reaction, singing "You're not fit to wear the shirt" and he was disciplined by the club soon after.[7] He issued the following apology: "I am just so angry with myself," Ghaly told the official Spurs site. "I have always considered it an honour to wear the Tottenham shirt and I never intended to show any disrespect".<br>"I knew things weren't happening for me out there, my play was terrible and I could hear the crowd jeering me. I was so upset at the fans' reaction. I have enjoyed playing in front of the club's supporters all season and I felt I had given of my best all the time and played some decent football. It is always hard to accept being substituted after such a short period of time and I was upset and taken aback by the cheering. I am a player who plays with my heart".<br>I know my reaction was totally wrong. I have apologised to the manager and I also want to apologise to the fans. I hope they don't judge me on this incident alone. I have tried hard for the club this season<br>onetheless, he was not to play for the club again. He stated that he wished to leave Tottenham due to his frustration at being unable to play in central midfield.[8]

In July 2007, he was set to move to Birmingham City for a fee of £3 million (subject to work permit approval).[9] However, on 3 August, Birmingham announced they would not be completing the deal after a training ground disagreement with manager Steve Bruce.</p><br>
<p id="paral4"> Aboutrika finished 3rd in the goalscoring rankings in the Egyptian League, while also helping his teammate Emad Moteab finish as the competition's top scorer. Also in 2005, Aboutrika played a great role in Al Ahly victory of the 2005 CAF Champions League, he scored an amazing goal in the final with an outrageous effort from 30 yards out against Étoile Sportive du Sahel of Tunisia in a game that ended 3–0 for Al Ahly.

Al Ahly qualified for the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship but finished last, Aboutrika told FIFA.com the reason saying: "Our problem was that we lost our form, for some reason we could not play like we had before arriving in Japan".</p>
